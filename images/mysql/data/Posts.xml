And another question I posted was closed within 24 hours. At that point it became overwhelmingly clear to me that I would not be able to post questions that the majority deemed on-topic, and I stopped trying to think of thoughtful questions. I suspect that many other members in this community where 512 people committed went through a very query thought process, and I suspect that the long-term survival prospects for that community are poor as a result of this rather intolerant mindset on the part of what was apparently a majority within that community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I even had a few members who (it seemed to me) followed me around the community down-voting every possible post I made. Comments can only be up-voted, so my participation quickly became limited to comments after I contributed my bare minimum necessary to fulfill my commitment. If there had been an uncommit option available to me, I would most definitely have used it because it felt like I was trying to get into a private club that clearly wanted no part of my contributions. This was a rather bizarre feeling given that I had started all starry-eyed and idealistic about helping to found the new community and my idealism quickly turned to cynicism. This also happened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/60731/how-do-i-uncommit-from-a-stack-exchange-proposal/&quot;&gt;another SE user awhile ago with another beta community&lt;/a&gt;, and it resulted in him wanting to uncommit from his beta as well. Looking at the number of up-votes on his question, it seems that there are a goodly number of people who end up feeling this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is apparently no &quot;uncommit&quot; option currently available in the SE software, but I don't think that any new beta community is likely to want to instill the feeling in any of its members that they want to uncommit, for it's not too hard to do the bare minimum required to fulfill one's commitment and then stop contributing (which is, in essence, uncommitting). If many people do that in any new beta then the beta is not likely to survive for long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NE.SE had 512 committers. If all of them had posted 10 questions, they'd have 5,120 questions in their community. Yet on Day 14 of their beta, &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/52519/network-engineering&quot;&gt;they actually have &amp;lt;200 questions&lt;/a&gt;. Although I was not in on the private beta for &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49551/reverse-engineering&quot;&gt;Reverse Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, I watched their public beta question-per-day ratio fall steadily down to ~1 question per day on Day 63 of their beta which I feel certain is bound to doom that community. I think these are all &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; telling details and cautionary developments to nota bene for every new beta which is why I'm posting so much detail in this question about what should be off-topic here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a general problem that all new betas are susceptible to. The potential exists for little cliques to form where minority opinions are quickly drummed out of the community by gang-like majorities who are rather intolerant of minority opinions. When that happens, many community members quickly become &lt;a href=&quot;https://networkengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/93/we-need-your-questions-now/#comment-115&quot;&gt;intimidated&lt;/a&gt; and reluctant to contribute, and the long-term effect is that the number of thoughtful questions getting posted to the site begins to fall off rapidly. This naturally leads to an early death for the beta community. So I think it's something that every new beta needs to be especially careful about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="47" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:31:56.127" LastActivityDate="2013-06-04T04:16:43.800" Title="What should be off-topic" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;questions&gt;" AnswerCount="4" CommentCount="3" />

This is a challenge that an expert freelancer can answer definitively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I made a suggested edit to change the last part of the question to be: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As someone who works full time, how can I market myself as a freelancer in a way that gets results and that doesn't take constant maintenance to keep up?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This helps hammer home what it is that we, as answerers, need to focus on when answering the question.

These differences may be significant enough to make those answers incorrect or even detrimental, and it may not be possible for the layperson to determine whether or not the answers apply to them based on their inability to determine if the law applies in their specific circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much what the too localized close reason is about -- situations that are so specific to one person to where they're not likely to be useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, many issues do loosely relate to law but don't necessarily require a lawyer to answer, so we shouldn't necessarily close questions simply because a lawyer &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be involved.

I've never thought to do this, but is this something people do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the answers to these questions are &quot;yes&quot;, then we should recognize that some questions posted here may overlap somewhat in scope with our neighbors at OnStartups.

Does a small business fall into the freelancer/self-employed category?  What criteria must a small business have in order to be considered in the same category as the self-employed/freelancing crowd?

I don't think that will happen on this question, but it's still harder to tailor the answers so that they apply to your specific situation. What's more, every answer will likely be correct, which makes it harder to vote the best information to the top.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/&quot;&gt;Real Questions Have Answers&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible ways to improve the post:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While your question in your current format may not fit the model, that doesn't mean you don't have some kind of question you could ask. Instead, start by thinking about why you're asking for this list. What specifically are you most worried about in getting started freelancing? If you don't know pros and cons, start by spending 5 minutes Googling them.  The pros and cons are likely already answered elsewhere, and this will lead to a deeper question that will encourage answers with more depth, experience, facts, and references. This not only will help you more, but it will help this site during it's most critical period, the private beta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we're essentially architects who are designing a new Stack Exchange Q&amp;amp;A site, and the questions we ask in the next few weeks will determine the tone of the site for years to come. Questions that show we've put thought into them will more likely attract the experts we need to make a viable site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When this site moves to public beta and is opened up to the world, we want to ensure there's good content that makes people want to contribute more great content. Hope this helps, and good luck with your edits to your question! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastActivityDate="2013-05-23T04:32:42.950" CommentCount="0" />

The law is a very complicated animal, and even people who have what seems to be a very query problem may in fact have different results due to a wide variety of factors.

Contracts may contain loopholes, or they may supercede rights that would be reserved to one party had a contract not existed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of these questions may have answers that won't apply to future visitors, and it may be difficult for those visitors to determine what does and doesn't apply to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I wouldn't list them as off-topic either.

In the United States, you can go to the IRS Website and apply for an EIN Federal Tax ID, which means you don't have to give your personal social security number to clients who contract with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If that's not an option, just do some basic research on the client. If they're well-established, they likely have a website, some reviews, public artifacts on the Internet that verify that they exist and are indeed legitimate.

If we want to nitpick, the requirements of a Canadian freelancer to send an invoice to a Canadian customer are different than they are to send the invoice to a US customer.  For example, there is no reason to send the tax registration numbers to a US customer, but you would have to send them to a Canadian customer.  Similarly if you are in the UK, you would send your VAT number to a UK customer or a French customer but it would not be required to send it to a Canadian customer.  &lt;strong&gt;The fact that the requirements end up specifically pertaining to not only the issuer of the invoice but the recipient make this extremely fact-bound.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I would like to see is some tolerance for modestly overbroad questions, provided they can be summarized and pointers given as to likely trouble spots for local laws.

The Workplace SE is for questions about navigating the professional setting, including career questions, salary negotiation, interviewing, and professionalism in the workplace, whereas Freelancing SE is for questions relating to self-employed or Freelance workers, many who don't have a traditional workplace like what we see on The Workplace SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most questions on the Workplace involve situations that happen where the asker is an employee or seeking to become an employee of a company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Freelancing SE, most of the questions have been asked by freelancers, contractors, or consultants. This group of people doesn't see themselves as employees but as independent entities. Thus, the problems faced are different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I get the impression that Stack Exchange, in general, has many contractors and freelancers who volunteer here, which is why questions that could be on-topic on other sites sometimes find a home on The Workplace. Project Management SE and Workplace SE oftentimes have questions asked that could arguably fit better on the other site, but the questions just aren't off topic and should only be migrated away if they are indeed off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to where to post your questions. If you're an employee who hired a consultant, and this leads to a problem within the workplace, perhaps the question would fit better on The Workplace SE. But if you're a consultant and you have a problem, it may be better to ask it here.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases where a question would be on-topic in both places, the deciding factor oftentimes comes down to the audience: Do you want an answer from the perspective of workplace professionals or from the perspective of professional freelancers?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They key to success is educating people who post questions on the other sites and letting them know an alternative exists, one that may better suit their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastActivityDate="2013-07-06T17:37:49.957" CommentCount="0" />

This phenomenon can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled.

In some project management contexts, change management refers to a project management process wherein &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;changes to a project are formally introduced and approved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the project management side of the change management definition also applies to two of the three questions tagged by &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/changes&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;changes&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt;.

Searching for &quot;change management&quot; or &quot;scope creep&quot; give us results more closely related to these topics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, it sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/change-management&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;change-management&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;change-management&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scope-creep&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scope-creep&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scope-creep&lt;/a&gt; would be a better choice for these questions, both for readability and search engine optimization.

Let's use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/a/600/64&quot;&gt;partial, recent answer by Oded&lt;/a&gt; as an example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You need to consider your expenses and overheads - everything that you pay out in order to complete a job. This, divided by the amount of time you estimate a job to take, will give you a estimated break-even rate - a rate that will end up with no profits or liabilities (assuming your estimates are correct). This is your rock bottom rate - possibly a rate to attract customers with, but not a long term rate that you can profit from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oded didn't cite a source, but I don't think he really needed to, since he did a great job explaining why and how, two important ingredients from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;Good Subjective, Bad Subjective&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, Oded's great information is also backed up by a great blog post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christopherspenn.com/2012/07/how-to-set-your-consultant-billing-rate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Christopher Penn, titled &quot;How to set your consultant billing rate&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I've never heard of Chris Penn, and he's not a user on our site, but he is a public speaker and writes a lot of stuff that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate his comparison between the ceiling and the floor. Read his article to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, would it be helpful to edit existing answers to enhance them with links to reputable freelancing blogs in hopes that referral traffic might make them want to check us out? Could it justify us reaching out to these bloggers and asking them to return the favor by writing an article about us or mentioning us in their next speaking event?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to edit anyone's answer without first engaging the community, as I don't want anyone to think their answer was somehow lacking.

The asker has a problem that he or she believes can be solved by obtaining a piece of software, so the asker posts a question on a forum or Q&amp;amp;A site in hopes of crowdsourcing a solution. However, these questions tend to be problematic for a number of different reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The asker doesn't do any research on his or her own, something that generally produces much better questions more likely to attract experts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They don't describe the problem in detail that the software should solve.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They don't treat our community as experts but instead treat us as a proxy to a Google search.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They don't focus on learning. Stack Exchange exists to help teach folks how to fish, not merely &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt; them a fish.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These questions tend to attract spam and low quality answers that are nothing more than a link to a third party site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As technology moves very fast, the answers may soon become outdated and useless to future visitors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Stack Exchange blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A Is Hard, Let's Go Shopping&lt;/a&gt;, Stack Exchange Co-Founder and CTO Jeff Atwood describes how these questions could possibly be reworded to focus more on the Stack Exchange mission, to provide expert answers to questions that explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; and that &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; not merely tell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, if we can coax the motivation for asking such a question from the asker, we may be able to provide an actual answer to the problem, not just a link to a resource that may or may not still be valid a year from now. One way to do this is to ask how one might evaluate software that solves a particular problem, query to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/&quot;&gt;examples cited in the blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of a bad question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What’s the best low light point-and-shoot camera?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A: Canon S90 and Lumix LX3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of a better way to word that question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I tell which point-and-shoot cameras take good low light photos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A: I strongly recommend looking for something with&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;a fast lens (2.0 at least)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;reasonable ISO handling (at least 400, but preferably 800)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the biggest sensor available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sum of these factors are really critical for low light situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the former question will be useless in a year, the latter question will still be valuable long after the answers are posted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without serious editing, these posts may very well harm our quality in the long run, as people who visit the site a year from now, who find outdated answers, may be less likely to come back and use this resource again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I propose adding these questions as a custom, off-topic reason and that we as a community do everything in our power to first try to edit them into shape.

Now that we're well into our public beta, you've probably noticed our core group of users have run out of questions to ask. This is normal, as a site cannot sustain itself without a steady stream of new users. Every day, we get a question or two asked by users new to the community. It's this new influx of new users which will help sustain and grow the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way to get more traffic into Freelancing SE is to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;increase the number of referring sites/inbound links&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There are blogs, forums, and other websites out there with conversations that are relevant to our site. Many of these will represent unanswered questions, questions that can be answered by posting a brief summary and a link to the thread on our site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, I noticed we have not submitted any posts to Reddit:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/domain/freelancing.stackexchange.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/domain/freelancing.stackexchange.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange incentivizes us to share these links. Underneath each post is a &quot;share&quot; link. When clicked, it gives you a link that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/q/3/64&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where the first item in the path designates whether the post is a question or answer, the second item is the post ID, and the third item is your user ID. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you share these links &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;outside of the Stack Exchange network&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, any clicks on these links from unique IP addresses count towards you earning the  following badges:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/59/announcer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZZ4u.png&quot; alt=&quot;announcer badge&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 25 unique IP addresses&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/60/booster&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5RJB.png&quot; alt=&quot;booster badge!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 300 unique IP addresses&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/61/publicist&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Viow8.png&quot; alt=&quot;publicist badge!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 1000 unique IP addresses&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These badges are arguably the most special on the site, because it's not just about you expanding your SE flair.

No, not the kind where you go in the little booth and vote for the person less likely to break the government, but the kind where you as a member of the community rank posts by their usefulness, using upvotes and downvotes to help push the best material to the top and the worst content to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voting plays a key role in our community's health. The more content that's voted, the better organized it becomes. What's more, this divvies up more power to the community so community members can take a larger role in site moderation activities.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two voting badges that tell us how we're doing as a community in terms of voting.

Also, there's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/62/suffrage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AV7Y0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Suffrage Badge&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; badge, which you can  earn by using at least 30 votes in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trick to claiming the Vox Populi badge is to use at least 10 votes on questions, which get ranked on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes&quot;&gt;top questions by votes&lt;/a&gt; page. If you only vote on answers, you're limited to only 30 votes. This limitation helps ensure we don't forget to vote on questions too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, many of you might not be interested in the flair, and that's fine. When we look at the badges page and see that a lot of users have earned these participation badges, it is a small sign that we're doing the right things to create a useful site.

There's really no rules in chat other than just be nice, so it's low pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also a good time to go through and improve posts by making suggested edits or to flag content that needs moderator attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:57:34.497" LastActivityDate="2013-11-12T04:38:28.353" Title="Have we talked about voting yet?"

In order for the like button to be effective, you first have to have actual, real users using your software so that they will actually be motivated to join your Facebook community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only way for you to spread the word about your product offering in the initial stages of your product -- using social networking tools -- is for you to monitor the social networking sites and look for recent, active, conversations that relate to your product offering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say you're promoting a Cooking Q&amp;amp;A Stack Exchange site, and one of your friends posts a question about cooking on a rusted skillet.  This is a real time opportunity for you to respond to this inquiry and softly promote the Cooking Q&amp;amp;A site.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Look at the second response to the question)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHxdw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook Conversation Demonstrating Effective Promotion of a Service&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This same concept can apply to your investment software.  If you see posts on your wall or other friends walls about investment portfolio monitoring, this is the time to strike by posting a link to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; product or service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important that your post be made in a timely manner so that it becomes &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the conversation.  It's a thin line between appearing helpful and appearing spammy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This same social networking approach applies to recently posted tweets, Linked In comments, blog articles, and other forms of social networking.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://soshable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Dealers-Guide-to-Automotive-Social-Media-2011-v2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Dealer's Guide to Automotive Social Media&lt;/a&gt;.  On page 8, there is a query example of how to use Twitter to interact with people and promote your dealership.  The techniques here will work for your software as well.  The main difference between the Facebook example and the Twitter example is that, with Twitter, the author uses Twitter's search feature to locate &lt;strong&gt;active conversations about the topic and then contribute to those conversations.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of using Twitter to promote your software is that you can reach far more people than those who are only part of your network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastActivityDate="2013-11-24T00:29:24.170" CommentCount="0" />

Questions where we aren't the experts don't help us further our mission to be a site where experts come for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems like a question about how to use Elance effectively would be best answered by the people who built and who support Elance everyday in their daily work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems that questions about the software, the interface, technical details, and basic usage should be off-topic on our site, but if the question involves a Freelancing problem, something that would be best answered by a professional Freelancer who uses Elance in their daily work, then the question would likely be better asked here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be more clear, the question fits our format, it's just a matter of whether or not we as a community feel we can provide value on these questions or not.

Checking out how many &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=unanswered&quot;&gt;are unanswered&lt;/a&gt; is great (only 7, but 5 don't have any answers), and it seems people come, get their question answered, and leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would a contest help? Would a blog help? Perhaps. But I also see lots of low quality answers that don't give much detail, and rely on the person to either look elsewhere, or Google further for their answer. I think if we can improve some of the lower quality (i.e. 1 or 2 sentence) answers, that we can show we are all professionals, and know what we're talking about. Maybe having the people who answer lots, also ask some questions that they already know the answer to, just to keep the community growing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all that said, let's remember that this is my first Beta that I started from scratch in, and I have seen it grow nicely in the beginning.

If an answerer is an expert on the topic, then he/she should easily be able to find supporting information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we cannot commit to doing that as a community, we may need to review whether or not we should allow legal questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, we really need more community members involved in the moderation process for this site to succeed. &lt;strong&gt;If you can't edit or retag, you can flag! :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a tag cleanup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most important aspect of the cleanup is to review the posts for quality. Removal of the tag is mostly ceremonial, since a Stack Exchange developer can simply run a query to remove the tags.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These tags no longer serve a purpose (or arguably never did serve a purpose), so we plan to remove them. But this is an opportunity to go through the questions and answers and look over them. Do they look neat, professional? Do they need some editing? Is there anything we should remove, close, reopen, etc? In essence, we use the tag removal as a sort of checklist of what posts we've reviewed and left in a good state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the regular community may have moved on and forgotten about these posts, they are viewed daily by visitors coming from Google. Posts that represent the kind of quality and expert level material we strive for is what will keep people coming back for more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Tag cleanups can also take the form of reviews. For instance, many answers in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legal&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;legal&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; may need some editing to back up answers with citations or references, but the tag will not be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Community Involvement&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which tags are the worst?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The area where we need the most help with the tag cleanup is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/client&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;client&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; tag. There are 73 questions. If you can retag, please help out. If you can edit to fix problems with a post, that helps too. If there's a problem you can't fix, either flag the post or create a meta discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember, the idea is to review the content and fix problems you see. Removing the tag is sort of an auxiliary goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legal&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;legal&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; tag, there are 30 questions. We should ask if the post needs the tag, and if it does, do the answers need references?  If so, we can either edit them, leave a comment, flag them for mod attention where we can either leave a comment ourselves, remove them if they're really bad, or add a &quot;citation needed&quot; post notice to the answer where we can come back to them later using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasnotice%3A1+is%3Aanswer+closed%3A0&quot;&gt;special filter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:57:34.497" LastActivityDate="2014-02-27T01:44:46.850" CommentCount="0" />

While up votes grant more privileges to members of our community, it's down votes that I wish to talk about today, as it's down votes that help keep poor quality content from eclipsing the good quality content on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I won't cite examples here, but I'm sure you've seen, or will eventually see, lower quality answers appearing above higher quality answers. This is a huge disservice to the folks who took the time to write great content, and we all have the power to fix this. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Down votes are perhaps the most accessible and most powerful tools of community moderation. It only takes &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-down&quot;&gt;125 reputation to down vote questions and answers&lt;/a&gt;. That means a large majority of the regular contributors of this site have the power to determine what content appears at the &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; and what content appears at the &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt;.  Down votes aren't about the people. Instead, down votes are about making sure content that doesn't quite meet our quality standards or that is dangerous or incorrect appears &lt;em&gt;below&lt;/em&gt; content that is correct, accurate, and that explains why and how.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to leave a comment or don't feel comfortable doing so, that's fine.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voting is completely anonymous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If you down vote a post, you are in no way obligated to leave a comment. This is &lt;em&gt;encouraged&lt;/em&gt;, but it is not &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt;. The actual act of voting, of pushing the content down (or up for up votes) is more important, so don't let commenting discourage you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do comment, separate the act of voting from the act of commenting. On posts I down vote, I generally leave a friendly comment such as this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hello user, welcome to Freelancing SE. On our Q&amp;amp;A site, we're generally looking for answers that address the full question and teach, not just tell. Consider making an [edit] to improve this post and prevent it from possibly being removed. If you need more guidance, check out [ask] for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[edit] is a short code link for the user to edit the post, and [ask] and [answer] are short code links for linking to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask&quot;&gt;&quot;How to Ask&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer&quot;&gt;&quot;How to Answer&quot;&lt;/a&gt; help center pages. &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If needed, moderators are happy to step in and leave comments with tips on how to improve a post. Such information need not come from the voters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you see low quality content that isn't useful because it doesn't provide detailed explanations, doesn't answer the question, or makes assumptions that may not be correct, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;take action and push that content to the bottom of the page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If a user comes back later and edits and improves the post later, review the content, and consider changing your vote.  Remember, votes on edited and improved posts can always be changed anytime after the edit, so long as your vote was cast prior to the edits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our site has come a long way and is full of useful content.

This allows for people to follow the account and see the questions directly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, each freelancing question may itself be difficult to categorise due to the wide number of fields in which it is possible to freelance, as you've mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did spend some time looking at the freelance culture on twitter and #selfemployed seemed to be doing well.

Mention your target market, a brief paragraph about the type of work you do, and the demographic of the client.  For instance, &quot;What should I include in a cover letter when targeting a client with 20 employees, who is in manufacturing, and who runs a flat, empowerment based organization with little hierarchy?&quot; would be something specific.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a specific question you could ask that could lead to answers which explain why and how, then this &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; work.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't promise it will work though.

Sorry I can't link to that discussion, but I read too much on too many meta boards to know where to begin searching for it.

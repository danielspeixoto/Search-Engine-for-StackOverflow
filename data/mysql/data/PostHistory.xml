And another question I posted was closed within 24 hours. At that point it became overwhelmingly clear to me that I would not be able to post questions that the majority deemed on-topic, and I stopped trying to think of thoughtful questions. I suspect that many other members in this community where 512 people committed went through a very similar thought process, and I suspect that the long-term survival prospects for that community are poor as a result of this rather intolerant mindset on the part of what was apparently a majority within that community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I even had a few members who (it seemed to me) followed me around the community down-voting every possible post I made. Comments can only be up-voted, so my participation quickly became limited to comments after I contributed my bare minimum necessary to fulfill my commitment. If there had been an uncommit option available to me, I would most definitely have used it because it felt like I was trying to get into a private club that clearly wanted no part of my contributions. This was a rather bizarre feeling given that I had started all starry-eyed and idealistic about helping to found the new community and my idealism quickly turned to cynicism. This also happened to [another SE user awhile ago with another beta community][3], and it resulted in him wanting to uncommit from his beta as well. Looking at the number of up-votes on his question, it seems that there are a goodly number of people who end up feeling this way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is apparently no &quot;uncommit&quot; option currently available in the SE software, but I don't think that any new beta community is likely to want to instill the feeling in any of its members that they want to uncommit, for it's not too hard to do the bare minimum required to fulfill one's commitment and then stop contributing (which is, in essence, uncommitting). If many people do that in any new beta then the beta is not likely to survive for long.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NE.SE had 512 committers. If all of them had posted 10 questions, they'd have 5,120 questions in their community. Yet on Day 14 of their beta, [they actually have &lt;200 questions][1]. Although I was not in on the private beta for [Reverse Engineering][2], I watched their public beta question-per-day ratio fall steadily down to ~1 question per day on Day 63 of their beta which I feel certain is bound to doom that community. I think these are all *very* telling details and cautionary developments to nota bene for every new beta which is why I'm posting so much detail in this question about what should be off-topic here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a general problem that all new betas are susceptible to. The potential exists for little cliques to form where minority opinions are quickly drummed out of the community by gang-like majorities who are rather intolerant of minority opinions. When that happens, many community members quickly become [intimidated][4] and reluctant to contribute, and the long-term effect is that the number of thoughtful questions getting posted to the site begins to fall off rapidly. This naturally leads to an early death for the beta community. So I think it's something that every new beta needs to be especially careful about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/52519/network-engineering&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49551/reverse-engineering&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/60731/how-do-i-uncommit-from-a-stack-exchange-proposal/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/93/we-need-your-questions-now/#comment-115" />

The best questions are those that contain some details about the problem, enough so that users can provide answers based on facts, references, and specific expertise. The community uses voting as a tool to identify the best answers and move them to the top. This helps future visitors who have the same problem quickly find the answers without having to wade through noise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But pros and cons questions sometimes tend to encourage users to post simple lists with no explanation. I don't think that will happen on this question, but it's still harder to tailor the answers so that they apply to your specific situation.

If you don't know pros and cons, start by spending 5 minutes Googling them.  The pros and cons are likely already answered elsewhere, and this will lead to a deeper question that will encourage answers with more depth, experience, facts, and references.

Questions involving law will usually be answered by experts, who will then give guidance and a disclaimer, though, so I look forward to seeing what others think.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For region specific questions, In the current (private) beta, there's a very high chance that no two people are from the same place. However, this isn't what the too localized close reason means. &quot;Too localized&quot; would be &quot;There's a giant purple dinosaur outside my house, what do?&quot;, not a well thought out question. The simple mention of a location **does not** mean a question is Too Localized." />

Those dealing with specifics should be off-topic as too localized.  Many of these are fact-dependent, and really if someone needs legal advice a lawyer is the right person to ask.  Questions might involve things like &quot;is claiming copyright to all the work I did for them. Here is the relevant portion of my contract. How should I go about responding to this?&quot;  The answer is &quot;hire a lawyer.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  those dealing with generalities may or may not be too vague, but I don't think they should be categorically discouraged.  Things like &quot;how formal should a contract be?&quot; or &quot;Should I include scope of work in the contract?&quot; are both good questions in this category.  &quot;What kind of business entity should I choose?&quot; is probably too vague or overly broad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly while much of this is somewhat country-specific, not all of it is.  Basic business functions of contracts are not that different around the world and despite there being large formal variations in copyright law worldwide, the overall goals and concepts are reasonably constant (the lines of what is protected or allowed vs not may not be however!) and so general answers for general questions may be possible." />

With personal finance, there are often questions that are specific to jurisdiction.  The idea is that if you are asking, say, a tax or legal question, or about specific kinds of retirement plans, then a country tag ought to be specified because those kinds of things vary according to jurisdiction.  For many other kinds of questions (e.g. investment strategies, budgeting), the country doesn't matter and can be left unspecified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This works well for us at *Money*, and I suggest a similar approach would work here at *Freelancing*, because some of the questions that are going to come up about freelancing will invariably be about establishing a business, realizing income, intellectual property or contract law, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words:  Certain kinds of questions here **should** have a country tag, and others would not necessarily need it.  Where the location matters, experts on the site ought to, using a comment, request the OP to disclose their location, so answers can be placed in the proper context.

We've just completed our review of the private beta. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The bad news:** this site isn't suitable to go public.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The good news:** it *could* be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two major problems that must be addressed before we'll be comfortable opening this site up to a broader audience:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Activity:** only about half the folks who committed to the proposal signed up initially; more have since come on board though, so that's looking up. More concerning is the paltry number of questions asked so far: 51 open, 60 total. That's not enough to really define the initial boundaries of the topic, much less create an inviting environment for new users. Remember, we tried this once before and [the site died on the vine][1] - y'all are doing a little bit better this time around, but... Not a lot better. Stack Exchange sites work best when there's a large body of knowledge to share, so seeing this few questions so far is disconcerting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  *That said*, there was a long weekend for a fair number of us coinciding with this beta, so it's worth assuming folks were busy elsewhere... But now's the time to fish up those questions you've been sitting on, invite those friends or colleagues you think would benefit from a site like this, and demonstrate that this subject has *legs!*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. **Quality:** It's not hard to find folks willing to pontificate on the topic of freelancing, or hang around and tell stories about their experiences. That's fun and all, but... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Why should I trust what someone here says I should do - can you support your assertions with anything? &#xD;&#xA; - Why are your stories more than idle entertainment - can they be generalized to illustrate a common pattern? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; The core idea of [Good Subjective Q&amp;A][2] is that answers must amount to *more* than opinions and idle chatter - if you can't write a persuasive argument *and [back it up][3]* with an explanation then you're adding noise, not signal. I don't want to overemphasize this - there *are* folks here writing fairly good answers - but it's entirely too easy to fall into a &quot;forum&quot; mentality that values *participation* over all else; after all, socializing is *fun*. To avoid this you must consciously work against it - not to stifle the fun, but to ensure that you're learning something *while* having fun. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a final note, it's great to see you actively discussing these problems here on meta.

Unfortunately unlike the SQL evaluation function I don't really know of a way to mitigate the inherent risks that come with such a request so whether you like it or not, that warning will remain part of my answer (I have experience with this to some extent as an employee).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to note that warnings of risk are not just there for you.  Someone else will read the question next month, next year, etc. so if I have reasons to say &quot;don't do this&quot; they need to be a part of may answer.

The difference to other sites that have been launched is not more than 50%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the problem I see is with the community of the site and the tendency to kill questions as **too localized**. For example, my question http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/93/eu-citizen-working-as-contractor-in-switzerland was nearly closed as too localized, because the community probably expected the formulation &quot;Working as contractor in other country?&quot;. Such question would initiate a long discussion (the community seems to enjoy it) with a lot of examples but no concrete answer to the situation of OP, since it strongly depends on the citizenship of OP and the target country.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Such open-end question would block the possible questions about people from Turkey, Russia, Latin America etc. wanting to work as contractors in EU, USA etc. Additionally, it depends on the branch of industry. The realities are other for people wanting to work as webmasters/developers, completely other for translators, drivers or guides. Thus instead of NxMxP questions that could be asked on the site, even in beta phase, we would have only 1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another my question, that **was** closed as too localized was http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/209/hourly-rate-for-experienced-java-contractors-in-germany. In my opinion it's a great question since it is very interesting to many people, and the information about that are very hard (if any) to find. It was closed as too localized on pretext that the rates would change in future. Yes they would, but in what perspective? 5 or 10 years. After that time they could be asked once again, or simply again answered. But so can **any** other question, that is not open-ended. The laws are changing constantly, the industry changes. Should the question about working as freelance taxi driver be closed as too localized, because in 10 years there could be no taxi drivers because all cars would be computer-steered?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without applying some common sense this site would die because of the wings chopped off at the very beginning.

Something like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;How do I decide if I should form an LLC?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;How do I decide if I should incorporate?

Tax jurisdiction is certainly an important detail when discussing invoicing and what is acceptable documentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does that mean there may be similar questions but each for a different country or tax jurisdiction?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Yes** and **let's embrace it**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We handle these issues just fine over at the [Personal Finance &amp; Money Stack Exchange](http://money.stackexchange.com) using location tags (and simply mentioning where you are, right in a question) and I invite anybody who is concerned about location tagging to drop by for a friendly visit :-)  We've hashed out these issues over a few years and have a good grip on when a question needs a location tag specified, and when it doesn't.  We have questions for the [U.S.][1], [Canada][2], [U.K.][3], [Australia][4], [India][5] .. and plenty of questions where *location didn't matter*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Experts should ask for the location to be disclosed _ *when it matters substantively*** _, and the OP should oblige, or else the question may be closed as *not a real question*, since it is **too broad** and not answerable in the current form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Also, have a look at Joel Spolsky's post at [The Wikipedia of Long Tail Programming Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/) and Jeff Atwood's post [Dr. Strangedupe: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love Duplication](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/).  Quoting from that one:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It’s far more common to have many subtle variations of a question. I&#xD;&#xA;&gt; think that’s OK, because that’s how the world works. Trying to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shoehorn a bunch of semi-related things into one arbitrary container&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in service of some Highlander-ish “there can be only one” rule is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ultimately harmful. Remember: while there are aspects of wiki to our&#xD;&#xA;&gt; system, we are not Wikipedia. There is not one canonical question&#xD;&#xA;&gt; about every possible subject.

The Workplace SE is for questions about navigating the professional setting, including career questions, salary negotiation, interviewing, and professionalism in the workplace, whereas Freelancing SE is for questions relating to self-employed or Freelance workers, many who don't have a traditional workplace like what we see on The Workplace SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, most questions on the Workplace involve situations that happen where the asker is an employee or seeking to become an employee of a company.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On Freelancing SE, most of the questions have been asked by freelancers, contractors, or consultants. This group of people doesn't see themselves as employees but as independent entities. Thus, the problems faced are different.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I get the impression that Stack Exchange, in general, has many contractors and freelancers who volunteer here, which is why questions that could be on-topic on other sites sometimes find a home on The Workplace. Project Management SE and Workplace SE oftentimes have questions asked that could arguably fit better on the other site, but the questions just aren't off topic and should only be migrated away if they are indeed off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to where to post your questions. If you're an employee who hired a consultant, and this leads to a problem within the workplace, perhaps the question would fit better on The Workplace SE. But if you're a consultant and you have a problem, it may be better to ask it here.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some cases where a question would be on-topic in both places, the deciding factor oftentimes comes down to the audience: Do you want an answer from the perspective of workplace professionals or from the perspective of professional freelancers?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They key to success is educating people who post questions on the other sites and letting them know an alternative exists, one that may better suit their needs." />

From this experience I'm familiar with the perception some have that freelance work is somehow less real or less accountable. On the other hand I was hired for one position specifically because of my freelance experience - the interviewer believed that freelancers had to be very focused on customer satisfaction in order to stay alive and that was a quality he valued highly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the question could be made more definitely on topic if it were rephrased to focus on what freelancers can do (or maybe could have done in the OP's case) so that if they choose to seek regular employment in the future they will be in a better position. Answers might include ideas about forming an official business name rather than operating under a sole proprietor's own name, what records to keep about each project in order to aid in writing a standard resume entry for the business in the future, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the answers to how to present your freelance work when applying for a job would also be largely relevant to how to present your freelance business when seeking new clients." />

Also, keep in mind that I'm not promoting spam but maybe a way to send some referral traffic to notable bloggers who post interesting stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My question is this: Can we attract more experts to our site by sending referral traffic their way?  Let's use a [partial, recent answer by Oded](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/a/600/64) as an example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You need to consider your expenses and overheads - everything that you pay out in order to complete a job. This, divided by the amount of time you estimate a job to take, will give you a estimated break-even rate - a rate that will end up with no profits or liabilities (assuming your estimates are correct). This is your rock bottom rate - possibly a rate to attract customers with, but not a long term rate that you can profit from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oded didn't cite a source, but I don't think he really needed to, since he did a great job explaining why and how, two important ingredients from [Good Subjective, Bad Subjective](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, Oded's great information is also backed up by a great blog post by [Christopher Penn, titled &quot;How to set your consultant billing rate&quot;](http://www.christopherspenn.com/2012/07/how-to-set-your-consultant-billing-rate/). Now, I've never heard of Chris Penn, and he's not a user on our site, but he is a public speaker and writes a lot of stuff that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate his comparison between the ceiling and the floor. Read his article to learn more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, would it be helpful to edit existing answers to enhance them with links to reputable freelancing blogs in hopes that referral traffic might make them want to check us out? Could it justify us reaching out to these bloggers and asking them to return the favor by writing an article about us or mentioning us in their next speaking event?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't want to edit anyone's answer without first engaging the community, as I don't want anyone to think their answer was somehow lacking.

The asker has a problem that he or she believes can be solved by obtaining a piece of software, so the asker posts a question on a forum or Q&amp;A site in hopes of crowdsourcing a solution. However, these questions tend to be problematic for a number of different reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The asker doesn't do any research on his or her own, something that generally produces much better questions more likely to attract experts.&#xD;&#xA;- They don't describe the problem in detail that the software should solve.&#xD;&#xA;- They don't treat our community as experts but instead treat us as a proxy to a Google search.&#xD;&#xA;- They don't focus on learning. Stack Exchange exists to help teach folks how to fish, not merely *give* them a fish.&#xD;&#xA;- These questions tend to attract spam and low quality answers that are nothing more than a link to a third party site.&#xD;&#xA;- As technology moves very fast, the answers may soon become outdated and useless to future visitors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the Stack Exchange blog post, [Q&amp;A Is Hard, Let's Go Shopping](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/), Stack Exchange Co-Founder and CTO Jeff Atwood describes how these questions could possibly be reworded to focus more on the Stack Exchange mission, to provide expert answers to questions that explain *why* and *how* and that *teach* not merely tell.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, if we can coax the motivation for asking such a question from the asker, we may be able to provide an actual answer to the problem, not just a link to a resource that may or may not still be valid a year from now. One way to do this is to ask how one might evaluate software that solves a particular problem, similar to the [examples cited in the blog post](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Example of a bad question:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Q: What’s the best low light point-and-shoot camera?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A: Canon S90 and Lumix LX3.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Example of a better way to word that question:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Q: How do I tell which point-and-shoot cameras take good low light photos?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A: I strongly recommend looking for something with&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - a fast lens (2.0 at least)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - reasonable ISO handling (at least 400, but preferably 800)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - the biggest sensor available&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - The sum of these factors are really critical for low light situations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the former question will be useless in a year, the latter question will still be valuable long after the answers are posted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without serious editing, these posts may very well harm our quality in the long run, as people who visit the site a year from now, who find outdated answers, may be less likely to come back and use this resource again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I propose adding these questions as a custom, off-topic reason and that we as a community do everything in our power to first try to edit them into shape. If they can't be improved, we should flag them or vote to close them if they don't describe a real, actual problem faced in the Freelancing sector." />

Now that we're well into our public beta, you've probably noticed our core group of users have run out of questions to ask. This is normal, as a site cannot sustain itself without a steady stream of new users. Every day, we get a question or two asked by users new to the community. It's this new influx of new users which will help sustain and grow the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way to get more traffic into Freelancing SE is to ***increase the number of referring sites/inbound links***. There are blogs, forums, and other websites out there with conversations that are relevant to our site. Many of these will represent unanswered questions, questions that can be answered by posting a brief summary and a link to the thread on our site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, I noticed we have not submitted any posts to Reddit:  http://www.reddit.com/domain/freelancing.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange incentivizes us to share these links. Underneath each post is a &quot;share&quot; link. When clicked, it gives you a link that looks something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- `http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/q/3/64` &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;where the first item in the path designates whether the post is a question or answer, the second item is the post ID, and the third item is your user ID. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you share these links ***outside of the Stack Exchange network***, any clicks on these links from unique IP addresses count towards you earning the  following badges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [![announcer badge][3]](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/59/announcer) - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 25 unique IP addresses&#xD;&#xA;- [![booster badge!][1]](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/60/booster) - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 300 unique IP addresses&#xD;&#xA;- [![publicist badge!][2]](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/61/publicist) - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 1000 unique IP addresses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These badges are arguably the most special on the site, because it's not just about you expanding your SE flair. Having a site with users who have earned these badges is a sign that the community is healthy and capable of growing into a sustainable Stack Exchange site. These badges can also be earned multiple times. I encourage you to go out into the world and let Freelancers know we are here! Good luck!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/W5RJB.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Viow8.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZZ4u.png" />

No, not the kind where you go in the little booth and vote for the person less likely to break the government, but the kind where you as a member of the community rank posts by their usefulness, using upvotes and downvotes to help push the best material to the top and the worst content to the bottom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Voting plays a key role in our community's health. The more content that's voted, the better organized it becomes. What's more, this divvies up more power to the community so community members can take a larger role in site moderation activities.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two voting badges that tell us how we're doing as a community in terms of voting. There's the [![Vox Populi Badge][1]](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/71/vox-populi) badge, which you can earn by using up all 40 of your votes in a single day.  Also, there's the [![Suffrage Badge][2]](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/62/suffrage) badge, which you can  earn by using at least 30 votes in a single day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The trick to claiming the Vox Populi badge is to use at least 10 votes on questions, which get ranked on the [top questions by votes](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes) page. If you only vote on answers, you're limited to only 30 votes. This limitation helps ensure we don't forget to vote on questions too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, many of you might not be interested in the flair, and that's fine. When we look at the badges page and see that a lot of users have earned these participation badges, it is a small sign that we're doing the right things to create a useful site. Moreover, it helps show that there are people out there who care about its success.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the time of this writing, I'm not on the list for either one of those two badges, so I'm going through the [top questions](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes) and am voting on content. I welcome you to join me. If you find anything interesting or noteworthy, jump into our [chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8874/freelancing) and share a link. Please don't be shy. The room is pretty quiet, and there's just a few of us who occasionally drop by. There's really no rules in chat other than just be nice, so it's low pressure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is also a good time to go through and improve posts by making suggested edits or to flag content that needs moderator attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wDzl2.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/AV7Y0.png" />

Answers OnStartups is shutting down, but this is worth preserving because the techniques described below also applies to how to promote any Stack Exchange site.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***This is a great example of how we can use our social networks to draw more users to our community:***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is more to social networking than just putting a Facebook like button on your website.  In order for the like button to be effective, you first have to have actual, real users using your software so that they will actually be motivated to join your Facebook community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only way for you to spread the word about your product offering in the initial stages of your product -- using social networking tools -- is for you to monitor the social networking sites and look for recent, active, conversations that relate to your product offering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, let's say you're promoting a Cooking Q&amp;A Stack Exchange site, and one of your friends posts a question about cooking on a rusted skillet.  This is a real time opportunity for you to respond to this inquiry and softly promote the Cooking Q&amp;A site.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*(Look at the second response to the question)*:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Facebook Conversation Demonstrating Effective Promotion of a Service][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This same concept can apply to your investment software.  If you see posts on your wall or other friends walls about investment portfolio monitoring, this is the time to strike by posting a link to *your* product or service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important that your post be made in a timely manner so that it becomes *part* of the conversation.  It's a thin line between appearing helpful and appearing spammy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This same social networking approach applies to recently posted tweets, Linked In comments, blog articles, and other forms of social networking.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**UPDATE:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, here is [The Dealer's Guide to Automotive Social Media](http://soshable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Dealers-Guide-to-Automotive-Social-Media-2011-v2.pdf).  On page 8, there is a similar example of how to use Twitter to interact with people and promote your dealership.  The techniques here will work for your software as well.  The main difference between the Facebook example and the Twitter example is that, with Twitter, the author uses Twitter's search feature to locate **active conversations about the topic and then contribute to those conversations.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The advantage of using Twitter to promote your software is that you can reach far more people than those who are only part of your network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/GHxdw.png" />

Additionally, those with 15 reputation or higher can flag duplicates. Identifying duplicate questions with answers will help prevent good information from being spread out across multiple posts and will link questions worded in slightly different ways to a single resource.

We are averaging just under 1 new question a day, which definitely needs some work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm personally impressed at how many questions *are* being answered, just not so many that are being marked as answered. Checking out how many [are unanswered](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=unanswered) is great (only 7, but 5 don't have any answers), and it seems people come, get their question answered, and leave.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Would a contest help? Would a blog help? Perhaps. But I also see lots of low quality answers that don't give much detail, and rely on the person to either look elsewhere, or Google further for their answer. I think if we can improve some of the lower quality (i.e. 1 or 2 sentence) answers, that we can show we are all professionals, and know what we're talking about. Maybe having the people who answer lots, also ask some questions that they already know the answer to, just to keep the community growing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With all that said, let's remember that this is my first Beta that I started from scratch in, and I have seen it grow nicely in the beginning.

Removal of the tag is mostly ceremonial, since a Stack Exchange developer can simply run a query to remove the tags.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These tags no longer serve a purpose (or arguably never did serve a purpose), so we plan to remove them. But this is an opportunity to go through the questions and answers and look over them. Do they look neat, professional? Do they need some editing? Is there anything we should remove, close, reopen, etc? In essence, we use the tag removal as a sort of checklist of what posts we've reviewed and left in a good state.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the regular community may have moved on and forgotten about these posts, they are viewed daily by visitors coming from Google. Posts that represent the kind of quality and expert level material we strive for is what will keep people coming back for more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note:** Tag cleanups can also take the form of reviews.

If so, we can either edit them, leave a comment, flag them for mod attention where we can either leave a comment ourselves, remove them if they're really bad, or add a &quot;citation needed&quot; post notice to the answer where we can come back to them later using a [special filter](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasnotice%3A1+is%3Aanswer+closed%3A0)." />

If you as a Freelancing SE community member see questions that don't meet these guidelines, here's what you can do: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If you have less that 500 reputation, please flag the post for moderator attention.&#xD;&#xA;- If you have at least 500 reputation, use your [close/reopen vote privileges](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/close-questions) to help put the question on hold. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we put a question on hold, we'll all take a deeper look to see if we can edit and improve it.

And another question I posted was closed within 24 hours. At that point it became overwhelmingly clear to me that I would not be able to post questions that the majority deemed on-topic, and I stopped trying to think of thoughtful questions. I suspect that many other members in this community where 512 people committed went through a very similar thought process, and I suspect that the long-term survival prospects for that community are poor as a result of this rather intolerant mindset on the part of what was apparently a majority within that community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I even had a few members who (it seemed to me) followed me around the community down-voting every possible post I made. Comments can only be up-voted, so my participation quickly became limited to comments after I contributed my bare minimum necessary to fulfill my commitment. If there had been an uncommit option available to me, I would most definitely have used it because it felt like I was trying to get into a private club that clearly wanted no part of my contributions. This was a rather bizarre feeling given that I had started all starry-eyed and idealistic about helping to found the new community and my idealism quickly turned to cynicism. This also happened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/60731/how-do-i-uncommit-from-a-stack-exchange-proposal/&quot;&gt;another SE user awhile ago with another beta community&lt;/a&gt;, and it resulted in him wanting to uncommit from his beta as well. Looking at the number of up-votes on his question, it seems that there are a goodly number of people who end up feeling this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is apparently no &quot;uncommit&quot; option currently available in the SE software, but I don't think that any new beta community is likely to want to instill the feeling in any of its members that they want to uncommit, for it's not too hard to do the bare minimum required to fulfill one's commitment and then stop contributing (which is, in essence, uncommitting). If many people do that in any new beta then the beta is not likely to survive for long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NE.SE had 512 committers. If all of them had posted 10 questions, they'd have 5,120 questions in their community. Yet on Day 14 of their beta, &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/52519/network-engineering&quot;&gt;they actually have &amp;lt;200 questions&lt;/a&gt;. Although I was not in on the private beta for &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49551/reverse-engineering&quot;&gt;Reverse Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, I watched their public beta question-per-day ratio fall steadily down to ~1 question per day on Day 63 of their beta which I feel certain is bound to doom that community.

And another question I posted was closed within 24 hours. At that point it became overwhelmingly clear to me that I would not be able to post questions that the majority deemed on-topic, and I stopped trying to think of thoughtful questions. I suspect that many other members in this community where 512 people committed went through a very similar thought process, and I suspect that the long-term survival prospects for that community are poor as a result of this rather intolerant mindset on the part of what was apparently a majority within that community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I even had a few members who (it seemed to me) followed me around the community down-voting every possible post I made. Comments can only be up-voted, so my participation quickly became limited to comments after I contributed my bare minimum necessary to fulfill my commitment. If there had been an uncommit option available to me, I would most definitely have used it because it felt like I was trying to get into a private club that clearly wanted no part of my contributions. This was a rather bizarre feeling given that I had started all starry-eyed and idealistic about helping to found the new community and my idealism quickly turned to cynicism. This also happened to [another SE user awhile ago with another beta community][3], and it resulted in him wanting to uncommit from his beta as well. Looking at the number of up-votes on his question, it seems that there are a goodly number of people who end up feeling this way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is apparently no &quot;uncommit&quot; option currently available in the SE software, but I don't think that any new beta community is likely to want to instill the feeling in any of its members that they want to uncommit, for it's not too hard to do the bare minimum required to fulfill one's commitment and then stop contributing (which is, in essence, uncommitting). If many people do that in any new beta then the beta is not likely to survive for long.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NE.SE had 512 committers. If all of them had posted 10 questions, they'd have 5,120 questions in their community. Yet on Day 14 of their beta, [they actually have &lt;200 questions][1]. Although I was not in on the private beta for [Reverse Engineering][2], I watched their public beta question-per-day ratio fall steadily down to ~1 question per day on Day 63 of their beta which I feel certain is bound to doom that community. I think these are all *very* telling details and cautionary developments to nota bene for every new beta which is why I'm posting so much detail in this question about what should be off-topic here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a general problem that all new betas are susceptible to.

While up votes grant more privileges to members of our community, it's down votes that I wish to talk about today, as it's down votes that help keep poor quality content from eclipsing the good quality content on the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I won't cite examples here, but I'm sure you've seen, or will eventually see, lower quality answers appearing above higher quality answers. This is a huge disservice to the folks who took the time to write great content, and we all have the power to fix this. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Down votes are perhaps the most accessible and most powerful tools of community moderation. It only takes [125 reputation to down vote questions and answers](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-down). That means a large majority of the regular contributors of this site have the power to determine what content appears at the *top* and what content appears at the *bottom*.  Down votes aren't about the people. Instead, down votes are about making sure content that doesn't quite meet our quality standards or that is dangerous or incorrect appears *below* content that is correct, accurate, and that explains why and how.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't want to leave a comment or don't feel comfortable doing so, that's fine.  ***Voting is completely anonymous.*** If you down vote a post, you are in no way obligated to leave a comment. This is *encouraged*, but it is not *required*. The actual act of voting, of pushing the content down (or up for up votes) is more important, so don't let commenting discourage you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do comment, separate the act of voting from the act of commenting. On posts I down vote, I generally leave a friendly comment such as this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hello user, welcome to Freelancing SE. On our Q&amp;A site, we're generally looking for answers that address the full question and teach, not just tell. Consider making an [edit] to improve this post and prevent it from possibly being removed. If you need more guidance, check out [ask] for more details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;[edit] is a short code link for the user to edit the post, and [ask] and [answer] are short code links for linking to the [&quot;How to Ask&quot;](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) and [&quot;How to Answer&quot;](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) help center pages. &lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If needed, moderators are happy to step in and leave comments with tips on how to improve a post. Such information need not come from the voters themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you see low quality content that isn't useful because it doesn't provide detailed explanations, doesn't answer the question, or makes assumptions that may not be correct, ***take action and push that content to the bottom of the page.*** If a user comes back later and edits and improves the post later, review the content, and consider changing your vote.  Remember, votes on edited and improved posts can always be changed anytime after the edit, so long as your vote was cast prior to the edits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our site has come a long way and is full of useful content. By using all of the moderation tools in our toolbox, we ensure that the standards we've set as a community remain high so we continue to provide value for years to come!" />

For instance, if someone were to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Has anyone ever used FreshBooks?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We would vote to close. But we'd also ask &quot;why do you ask if we've used FreshBooks&quot; and &quot;what problem are you facing with it?

Market saturation, is there a demand, need for a huge user base, pure luck, etc. I suspect that'd be closed because it's not really freelancing related." />

It doesn't seem likely this will work on our site, but since you asked, here are my thoughts below, which include some *possible*, but not guaranteed, ways this *might* work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Reviewing is off-topic&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reviewing the cover letter would be off-topic for this site, simply because it wouldn't fit the Q&amp;A format that is part of all Stack Exchange sites. It's also difficult to formulate specific questions about *your* cover letter that don't end up with the community reviewing the whole thing or taking something out of context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there is a way in which you *can* use the platform to seek assistance.  As someone with freelancing experience, you may very well have suspicions as to what might or might not be wrong with your cover letter. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Specific questions about cover letters could be on-topic&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Try to see if you can think of a question about cover letters in general. Mention your target market, a brief paragraph about the type of work you do, and the demographic of the client.  For instance, &quot;What should I include in a cover letter when targeting a client with 20 employees, who is in manufacturing, and who runs a flat, empowerment based organization with little hierarchy?&quot; would be something specific.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a specific question you could ask that could lead to answers which explain why and how, then this *could* work.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't promise it will work though. It's possible the post may be put on hold, either by the community or a moderator, until the post is edited to be on-topic. If that happens, it's not a reflection on you, and try to be open to feedback from the community on how you might edit the post to be on-topic. Look at this as an experiment to see what's possible and not possible on our site. Hope this helps." />

Why the flag resets, I don't know. Is there, per chance, other meaningful content to the offending comment, that might be worth saving. I learned from prior discussions that even moderators can't edit a comment after it's set. The poster can, for a brief time, but then it's keep/trash as the only choice. Of course, even if the other user isn't being nice, the comments on their own will damage his reputation with other users, even if it doesn't show in his numbers.

What @terdon comment said was&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, it's easy enough to dismiss a flag by mistake and there is no way of dismissing individual flags on the same content for different reasons (that I know of, anyway) so maybe yours was dismissed along with others that were wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the interface remains fairly consistent across SE sites, I have to presume that the same can be said of the dashboard for moderators.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not that this helps with the comment, but it might lessen the frustration of &quot;being ignored.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As another option, that I gathered from some meta somewhere, a last ditch effort to contact the moderators is to raise a flag for moderator flag on your own post, and explain in the custom reason area what the problem is. Sorry I can't link to that discussion, but I read too much on too many meta boards to know where to begin searching for it. An unfortunate byproduct of reading meta to try learning the site etiquette.&#xD;&#xA;" />

And another question I posted was closed within 24 hours. At that point it became overwhelmingly clear to me that I would not be able to post questions that the majority deemed on-topic, and I stopped trying to think of thoughtful questions. I suspect that many other members in this community where 512 people committed went through a very similar thought process, and I suspect that the long-term survival prospects for that community are poor as a result of this rather intolerant mindset on the part of what was apparently a majority within that community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I even had a few members who (it seemed to me) followed me around the community down-voting every possible post I made. Comments can only be up-voted, so my participation quickly became limited to comments after I contributed my bare minimum necessary to fulfill my commitment. If there had been an uncommit option available to me, I would most definitely have used it because it felt like I was trying to get into a private club that clearly wanted no part of my contributions. This was a rather bizarre feeling given that I had started all starry-eyed and idealistic about helping to found the new community and my idealism quickly turned to cynicism. This also happened to [another SE user awhile ago with another beta community][3], and it resulted in him wanting to uncommit from his beta as well. Looking at the number of up-votes on his question, it seems that there are a goodly number of people who end up feeling this way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is apparently no &quot;uncommit&quot; option currently available in the SE software, but I don't think that any new beta community is likely to want to instill the feeling in any of its members that they want to uncommit, for it's not too hard to do the bare minimum required to fulfill one's commitment and then stop contributing (which is, in essence, uncommitting). If many people do that in any new beta then the beta is not likely to survive for long.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NE.SE had 512 committers. If all of them had posted 10 questions, they'd have 5,120 questions in their community. Yet on Day 14 of their beta, [they actually have &lt;200 questions][1]. Although I was not in on the private beta for [Reverse Engineering][2], I watched their public beta question-per-day ratio fall steadily down to ~1 question per day on Day 63 of their beta which I feel certain is bound to doom that community. I think these are all *very* telling details and cautionary developments to nota bene for every new beta which is why I'm posting so much detail in this question about what should be off-topic here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a general problem that all new betas are susceptible to. The potential exists for little cliques to form where minority opinions are quickly drummed out of the community by gang-like majorities who are rather intolerant of minority opinions. When that happens, many community members quickly become [intimidated][4] and reluctant to contribute, and the long-term effect is that the number of thoughtful questions getting posted to the site begins to fall off rapidly. This naturally leads to an early death for the beta community. So I think it's something that every new beta needs to be especially careful about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/52519/network-engineering&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49551/reverse-engineering&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/60731/how-do-i-uncommit-from-a-stack-exchange-proposal/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://networkengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/93/we-need-your-questions-now/#comment-115" />

We've just completed our review of the private beta. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The bad news:** this site isn't suitable to go public.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The good news:** it *could* be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two major problems that must be addressed before we'll be comfortable opening this site up to a broader audience:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Activity:** only about half the folks who committed to the proposal signed up initially; more have since come on board though, so that's looking up. More concerning is the paltry number of questions asked so far: 51 open, 60 total. That's not enough to really define the initial boundaries of the topic, much less create an inviting environment for new users. Remember, we tried this once before and [the site died on the vine][1] - y'all are doing a little bit better this time around, but... Not a lot better. Stack Exchange sites work best when there's a large body of knowledge to share, so seeing this few questions so far is disconcerting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  *That said*, there was a long weekend for a fair number of us coinciding with this beta, so it's worth assuming folks were busy elsewhere... But now's the time to fish up those questions you've been sitting on, invite those friends or colleagues you think would benefit from a site like this, and demonstrate that this subject has *legs!*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. **Quality:** It's not hard to find folks willing to pontificate on the topic of freelancing, or hang around and tell stories about their experiences. That's fun and all, but... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Why should I trust what someone here says I should do - can you support your assertions with anything? &#xD;&#xA; - Why are your stories more than idle entertainment - can they be generalized to illustrate a common pattern? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; The core idea of [Good Subjective Q&amp;A][2] is that answers must amount to *more* than opinions and idle chatter - if you can't write a persuasive argument *and [back it up][3]* with an explanation then you're adding noise, not signal. I don't want to overemphasize this - there *are* folks here writing fairly good answers - but it's entirely too easy to fall into a &quot;forum&quot; mentality that values *participation* over all else; after all, socializing is *fun*. To avoid this you must consciously work against it - not to stifle the fun, but to ensure that you're learning something *while* having fun. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a final note, it's great to see you actively discussing these problems here on meta.

First, laws generally require specialized experts to interpret those laws; specifically, they require lawyers. Second, laws may be specific to a certain area or may be preempted by laws at different levels of government. This increases the chances that two people are *less* likely to have the same problem that is solvable with the same answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, there may be only slight differences between the details of one person's problem and another person's problem who finds the site from a Google search. These differences may be significant enough to make those answers incorrect or even detrimental, and it may not be possible for the layperson to determine whether or not the answers apply to them based on their inability to determine if the law applies in their specific circumstances. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is pretty much what the too localized close reason is about -- situations that are so specific to one person to where they're not likely to be useful to others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, many issues do loosely relate to law but don't necessarily require a lawyer to answer, so we shouldn't necessarily close questions simply because a lawyer *could* be involved. We should ask whether another person could have that problem and if it's easy to tell if another person's situation would apply before deciding to close the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because of their nature, these types of questions will probably need to be validated in some manner other than by simple voting. On the Workplace SE, the community proposed the idea of the [back it up rule](https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5/does-this-site-need-a-back-it-up-rule) where users posting such answers include references to back up their answer or experiences that happened to them personally. The side-benefit is that answers end up explaining both how and why, which helps make them easier to understand and learn from." />

And another question I posted was closed within 24 hours. At that point it became overwhelmingly clear to me that I would not be able to post questions that the majority deemed on-topic, and I stopped trying to think of thoughtful questions. I suspect that many other members in this community where 512 people committed went through a very similar thought process, and I suspect that the long-term survival prospects for that community are poor as a result of this rather intolerant mindset on the part of what was apparently a majority within that community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I even had a few members who (it seemed to me) followed me around the community down-voting every possible post I made. Comments can only be up-voted, so my participation quickly became limited to comments after I contributed my bare minimum necessary to fulfill my commitment. If there had been an uncommit option available to me, I would most definitely have used it because it felt like I was trying to get into a private club that clearly wanted no part of my contributions. This was a rather bizarre feeling given that I had started all starry-eyed and idealistic about helping to found the new community and my idealism quickly turned to cynicism. This also happened to [another SE user awhile ago with another beta community][3], and it resulted in him wanting to uncommit from his beta as well. Looking at the number of up-votes on his question, it seems that there are a goodly number of people who end up feeling this way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is apparently no &quot;uncommit&quot; option currently available in the SE software, but I don't think that any new beta community is likely to want to instill the feeling in any of its members that they want to uncommit, for it's not too hard to do the bare minimum required to fulfill one's commitment and then stop contributing (which is, in essence, uncommitting). If many people do that in any new beta then the beta is not likely to survive for long.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NE.SE had 512 committers. If all of them had posted 10 questions, they'd have 5,120 questions in their community. Yet on Day 14 of their beta, [they actually have &lt;200 questions][1]. Although I was not in on the private beta for [Reverse Engineering][2], I watched their public beta question-per-day ratio fall steadily down to ~1 question per day on Day 63 of their beta which I feel certain is bound to doom that community. I think these are all *very* telling details and cautionary developments to nota bene for every new beta which is why I'm posting so much detail in this question about what should be off-topic here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a general problem that all new betas are susceptible to. The potential exists for little cliques to form where minority opinions are quickly drummed out of the community by gang-like majorities who are rather intolerant of minority opinions. When that happens, many community members quickly become [intimidated][4] and reluctant to contribute, and the long-term effect is that the number of thoughtful questions getting posted to the site begins to fall off rapidly. This naturally leads to an early death for the beta community. So I think it's something that every new beta needs to be especially careful about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/52519/network-engineering&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49551/reverse-engineering&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/60731/how-do-i-uncommit-from-a-stack-exchange-proposal/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://networkengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/93/we-need-your-questions-now/#comment-115" />

A few examples: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [As a freelance web developer, should I bill for my learning curve?](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/q/9053/48)&#xD;&#xA;- [When should I inform management that I have been approached by a competitor?](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/q/618/48)&#xD;&#xA;- [Peaceful and professional way to drop out of a volunteer project that's gone bad](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/q/1705/48)&#xD;&#xA;- [What to do when recruiters don't count freelancing work as experience](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/q/298/48)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I'm not missing something obvious, all of the above would be on topic on Freelancing. I've even spotted a question that exists on both sites, in nearly identical form:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [How can we prepare for “getting hit by a bus”?](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/q/126) (Freelancing)&#xD;&#xA;- [How can I prepare for getting hit by a bus?](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/q/9128/48) (Workplace)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I realize that Stack Exchange sites sometimes overlap. In fact, &quot;freelancing and business concerns&quot; questions are also on topic on [Programmers](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/), the main site I'm active on. But the boundaries between Programmers and Freelancing, and Programmers and The Workplace are clear; Programmers is industry specific, that's what sets it apart. That's not the case though with the boundaries between Freelancing and The Workplace (imho).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What are the key differences between the two sites? As a freelancer, when should I prefer to post my questions on this site, instead of on The Workplace?" />

Does a small business fall into the freelancer/self-employed category?  What criteria must a small business have in order to be considered in the same category as the self-employed/freelancing crowd? Answering these questions will help us better determine the scope as well as how to tailor certain questions to fit that scope without changing their meaning.&#xD;&#xA;" />

The difference to other sites that have been launched is not more than 50%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the problem I see is with the community of the site and the tendency to kill questions as **too localized**. For example, my question https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/93/eu-citizen-working-as-contractor-in-switzerland was nearly closed as too localized, because the community probably expected the formulation &quot;Working as contractor in other country?&quot;. Such question would initiate a long discussion (the community seems to enjoy it) with a lot of examples but no concrete answer to the situation of OP, since it strongly depends on the citizenship of OP and the target country.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Such open-end question would block the possible questions about people from Turkey, Russia, Latin America etc. wanting to work as contractors in EU, USA etc. Additionally, it depends on the branch of industry. The realities are other for people wanting to work as webmasters/developers, completely other for translators, drivers or guides. Thus instead of NxMxP questions that could be asked on the site, even in beta phase, we would have only 1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another my question, that **was** closed as too localized was https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/209/hourly-rate-for-experienced-java-contractors-in-germany. In my opinion it's a great question since it is very interesting to many people, and the information about that are very hard (if any) to find. It was closed as too localized on pretext that the rates would change in future. Yes they would, but in what perspective? 5 or 10 years. After that time they could be asked once again, or simply again answered. But so can **any** other question, that is not open-ended. The laws are changing constantly, the industry changes. Should the question about working as freelance taxi driver be closed as too localized, because in 10 years there could be no taxi drivers because all cars would be computer-steered?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without applying some common sense this site would die because of the wings chopped off at the very beginning.

These local rules can be significant and sometimes strict, but regardless there is also a lot of room for a general answer which gives both a guide to the commonality between countries and an idea of what sorts of things may need to be asked of a local specialist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My thinking is that such a question should be on topic, because expecting a fully complete answer in a topic like this gets you into &quot;too localized&quot; territory quickly.  If we want to nitpick, the requirements of a Canadian freelancer to send an invoice to a Canadian customer are different than they are to send the invoice to a US customer.  For example, there is no reason to send the tax registration numbers to a US customer, but you would have to send them to a Canadian customer.  Similarly if you are in the UK, you would send your VAT number to a UK customer or a French customer but it would not be required to send it to a Canadian customer.  **The fact that the requirements end up specifically pertaining to not only the issuer of the invoice but the recipient make this extremely fact-bound.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I would like to see is some tolerance for modestly overbroad questions, provided they can be summarized and pointers given as to likely trouble spots for local laws.

This phenomenon can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled.

In some project management contexts, change management refers to a project management process wherein ***changes to a project are formally introduced and approved.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, the project management side of the change management definition also applies to two of the three questions tagged by [tag:changes].

Keep that in mind when thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of what I'm about to ask. Also, keep in mind that I'm not promoting spam but maybe a way to send some referral traffic to notable bloggers who post interesting stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My question is this: Can we attract more experts to our site by sending referral traffic their way?  Let's use a [partial, recent answer by Oded](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/a/600/64) as an example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You need to consider your expenses and overheads - everything that you pay out in order to complete a job. This, divided by the amount of time you estimate a job to take, will give you a estimated break-even rate - a rate that will end up with no profits or liabilities (assuming your estimates are correct). This is your rock bottom rate - possibly a rate to attract customers with, but not a long term rate that you can profit from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oded didn't cite a source, but I don't think he really needed to, since he did a great job explaining why and how, two important ingredients from [Good Subjective, Bad Subjective](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, Oded's great information is also backed up by a great blog post by [Christopher Penn, titled &quot;How to set your consultant billing rate&quot;](http://www.christopherspenn.com/2012/07/how-to-set-your-consultant-billing-rate/). Now, I've never heard of Chris Penn, and he's not a user on our site, but he is a public speaker and writes a lot of stuff that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate his comparison between the ceiling and the floor. Read his article to learn more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, would it be helpful to edit existing answers to enhance them with links to reputable freelancing blogs in hopes that referral traffic might make them want to check us out? Could it justify us reaching out to these bloggers and asking them to return the favor by writing an article about us or mentioning us in their next speaking event?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't want to edit anyone's answer without first engaging the community, as I don't want anyone to think their answer was somehow lacking.

Now that we're well into our public beta, you've probably noticed our core group of users have run out of questions to ask. This is normal, as a site cannot sustain itself without a steady stream of new users. Every day, we get a question or two asked by users new to the community. It's this new influx of new users which will help sustain and grow the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way to get more traffic into Freelancing SE is to ***increase the number of referring sites/inbound links***. There are blogs, forums, and other websites out there with conversations that are relevant to our site. Many of these will represent unanswered questions, questions that can be answered by posting a brief summary and a link to the thread on our site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, I noticed we have not submitted any posts to Reddit:  http://www.reddit.com/domain/freelancing.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange incentivizes us to share these links. Underneath each post is a &quot;share&quot; link. When clicked, it gives you a link that looks something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- `https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/q/3/64` &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;where the first item in the path designates whether the post is a question or answer, the second item is the post ID, and the third item is your user ID. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you share these links ***outside of the Stack Exchange network***, any clicks on these links from unique IP addresses count towards you earning the  following badges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [![announcer badge][3]](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/59/announcer) - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 25 unique IP addresses&#xD;&#xA;- [![booster badge!][1]](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/60/booster) - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 300 unique IP addresses&#xD;&#xA;- [![publicist badge!][2]](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/61/publicist) - Shared a link to a question that was visited by 1000 unique IP addresses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These badges are arguably the most special on the site, because it's not just about you expanding your SE flair. Having a site with users who have earned these badges is a sign that the community is healthy and capable of growing into a sustainable Stack Exchange site. These badges can also be earned multiple times. I encourage you to go out into the world and let Freelancers know we are here!

No, not the kind where you go in the little booth and vote for the person less likely to break the government, but the kind where you as a member of the community rank posts by their usefulness, using upvotes and downvotes to help push the best material to the top and the worst content to the bottom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Voting plays a key role in our community's health. The more content that's voted, the better organized it becomes. What's more, this divvies up more power to the community so community members can take a larger role in site moderation activities.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two voting badges that tell us how we're doing as a community in terms of voting. There's the [![Vox Populi Badge][1]](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/71/vox-populi) badge, which you can earn by using up all 40 of your votes in a single day.  Also, there's the [![Suffrage Badge][2]](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/badges/62/suffrage) badge, which you can  earn by using at least 30 votes in a single day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The trick to claiming the Vox Populi badge is to use at least 10 votes on questions, which get ranked on the [top questions by votes](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes) page. If you only vote on answers, you're limited to only 30 votes. This limitation helps ensure we don't forget to vote on questions too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, many of you might not be interested in the flair, and that's fine. When we look at the badges page and see that a lot of users have earned these participation badges, it is a small sign that we're doing the right things to create a useful site. Moreover, it helps show that there are people out there who care about its success.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the time of this writing, I'm not on the list for either one of those two badges, so I'm going through the [top questions](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes) and am voting on content.

The room is pretty quiet, and there's just a few of us who occasionally drop by. There's really no rules in chat other than just be nice, so it's low pressure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is also a good time to go through and improve posts by making suggested edits or to flag content that needs moderator attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wDzl2.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/AV7Y0.png" />

Additionally, those with 15 reputation or higher can flag duplicates. Identifying duplicate questions with answers will help prevent good information from being spread out across multiple posts and will link questions worded in slightly different ways to a single resource.

Removing the tag is sort of an auxiliary goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the [tag:legal] tag, there are 30 questions. We should ask if the post needs the tag, and if it does, do the answers need references?  If so, we can either edit them, leave a comment, flag them for mod attention where we can either leave a comment ourselves, remove them if they're really bad, or add a &quot;citation needed&quot; post notice to the answer where we can come back to them later using a [special filter](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasnotice%3A1+is%3Aanswer+closed%3A0)." />

This is a huge disservice to the folks who took the time to write great content, and we all have the power to fix this. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Down votes are perhaps the most accessible and most powerful tools of community moderation. It only takes [125 reputation to down vote questions and answers](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-down). That means a large majority of the regular contributors of this site have the power to determine what content appears at the *top* and what content appears at the *bottom*.  Down votes aren't about the people. Instead, down votes are about making sure content that doesn't quite meet our quality standards or that is dangerous or incorrect appears *below* content that is correct, accurate, and that explains why and how.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't want to leave a comment or don't feel comfortable doing so, that's fine.  ***Voting is completely anonymous.*** If you down vote a post, you are in no way obligated to leave a comment. This is *encouraged*, but it is not *required*. The actual act of voting, of pushing the content down (or up for up votes) is more important, so don't let commenting discourage you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do comment, separate the act of voting from the act of commenting. On posts I down vote, I generally leave a friendly comment such as this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hello user, welcome to Freelancing SE. On our Q&amp;A site, we're generally looking for answers that address the full question and teach, not just tell. Consider making an [edit] to improve this post and prevent it from possibly being removed. If you need more guidance, check out [ask] for more details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;[edit] is a short code link for the user to edit the post, and [ask] and [answer] are short code links for linking to the [&quot;How to Ask&quot;](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) and [&quot;How to Answer&quot;](https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) help center pages. &lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If needed, moderators are happy to step in and leave comments with tips on how to improve a post. Such information need not come from the voters themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you see low quality content that isn't useful because it doesn't provide detailed explanations, doesn't answer the question, or makes assumptions that may not be correct, ***take action and push that content to the bottom of the page.*** If a user comes back later and edits and improves the post later, review the content, and consider changing your vote.  Remember, votes on edited and improved posts can always be changed anytime after the edit, so long as your vote was cast prior to the edits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our site has come a long way and is full of useful content.

Down vote low quality content so it doesn't appear at the top of the page, and up vote quality content.

Editing is the most powerful feature on Stack Exchange. With the editing tools, we can transform our content into high quality questions and answers that will help future visitors for years to come.

Freelance workers are sometimes represented by a company or a temporary agency that resells freelance labor to clients; others work independently or use professional associations or websites to get work. &quot;Independent contractor&quot; would be the term used in a higher register of English that designates the tax and employment class of this type of worker. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Independent contractor&#xD;&#xA;-----------------&#xD;&#xA;&gt; An independent contractor is a natural person, business, or corporation that provides goods or services to another entity under terms specified in a contract or within a verbal agreement.

Therefore, one of the questions I link to constantly when someone asks what to charge includes *how* to determine what to charge. As the old adage goes, &quot;Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, he's fed for life&quot;. We need to teach these Freelancers to be self-sufficient to a point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I may be wrong, but I'd welcome the discussion.

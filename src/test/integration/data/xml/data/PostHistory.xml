On the other hand, this could be argued and discussed all day).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for capitalization, tags are lowercase because of the Stack Exchange engine; by default, all tags will be `.lower()`ed (and spaces will be converted to `-` if they aren't treated as separators). If we really need tags to be uppercase, would could have the first round of moderators appointed by Stack Exchange to ask the development team to implement this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I don't really think it's necessary to use capitals (I am British however, and I don't have too much experience with state-specific workplace problems as a result, so feel free to disagree)" />

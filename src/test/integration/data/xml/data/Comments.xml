  <row Id="2" PostId="6" Score="1" Text="Hi Copyright, I'm sorry your experience has been a bit rocky. Can you post a link to the get_question you're referring to? Meta is the place for constructive feedback about how to define the site topic, and without context, all we can really do is speculate. Hope this helps!"

  <row Id="5" PostId="6" Score="0" Text="@jmort253 I'm totally over it. I don't feel a need to link to any particular get_question. The one get_question that I posted and did not test_delete from that community still stands (as closed), and I think it speaks for itself. I do hope NE.SE survives, but I want nothing from there now except for my commitment to be marked as fulfilled on my Area51 profile. I wish them all the best, but without me. :)" CreationDate="2013-05-22T02:05:01.133" UserId="47" />

  <row Id="10" PostId="15" Score="0" Text="The too localized close reason is really reserved for situations that are so specific to where they're very likely to apply to more than one person. If I'm in California, chances are, my problem may very well apply to others in California as well, which means it wouldn't be too localized. I don't see those as a problem, but it's not a bad idea to keep an eye out for a pattern that may prove harmful." CreationDate="2013-05-22T05:56:01.580" UserId="64" />
